# Fig Furry: Top-Down RPG Game About Battling Wasps


## Description

**Fig Furry** is a dynamic action game created during a 32-hour Game Jam, with the theme centered around figs. Our team, consisting of three Unreal Engine Developers and a 2D/3D Artist, dedicated this time to crafting a game where players take on the role of Fig the Wizard. Our mission? To defeat the ancient enemies of figs: wasps.

## Key Features

- **Top-Down RPG**: The game is set in a top-down view, allowing players to control Fig the Wizard as they traverse various levels.
- **Wasp Battle**: Our task is to defeat hordes of wasps that lay eggs in figs to reproduce.
- **Environmental Obstacles**: Along the way, we'll encounter various environmental obstacles such as spikes and rotating beams. We must overcome them to progress.
- **Resource Management**: Players must manage three crucial resources: Earth, Water, and Sun. Without them, no plant (including Fig the Wizard) can survive. If any resource drops to zero, our hero perishes.
- **Enemy Weaknesses**: Wasps have their weaknesses. By shooting projectiles of the appropriate type, we can decrease their resource levels.
- **Mission Objective**: To proceed, we must defeat all enemies in our path and save the figs from the wasps!

## Technologies

- The game was developed using the Unreal Engine.
- 2D/3D graphics were created using Blender.
